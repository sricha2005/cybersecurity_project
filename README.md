# cybersecurity_project
This project demonstrates a secure encryption and decryption mechanism using symmetric keys in Python. It supports encrypted command execution, unique ID-based storage, and activity logging for cybersecurity learning and remote administration concepts.
Password input is hidden using Python's getpass module to follow secure input practices.
